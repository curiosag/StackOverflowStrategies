                    good to the evil, intended to get the unsuspecting going and getting along on the rugged terrain of
                    the <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> ("SO") site and its diverse population.
                    This isn't
                    a moralistic or political endevour, it is about navigating circumstances that you otherwise can't

                    may be a different thing). You'll encounter enough morality wrecking havoc on SO. If you think it is
                    spineless and opportunistic: that's intentional.<br><br>

                            where
                            the reply is a snippet of code (garnished with some phrases for the literary appeal).

                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><b>GOOD</b> Resilience. That's not the Nobel price commission descending on you judging
                            the worthiness of your contribution for mankind. It may rather be a maladjusted jobless
                            freak with a computer and too much time or a some deviant students burning the subsidies
                            they get from their parents. When getting down-voted, improve and try again.<br><br>

                            If you're lucky and someone commented what actually was wrong, use the information, and drop
                            the emotional content (if negative). Don't get into comment wars, you can't win, but you can
                            get reputation deducted (-2 for annoying a mod, in my experience).

                        </p></li>
                        <li><p><b>GOOD</b> Remain respectful, also in the face of an hair raising OP. Apart from any
                            moral aspect you're creating a barrier for the questioner to accept (+15!) your answer,
                            when, while maybe correct and technically helpful, it conveys a judgment about the OP being
                            e.g. an incompetent, pretentious idiot. Watch your words, contempt may even ooze out between
                            the lines. Outright unfriendly comments or worse will get you warnings or bans.<br><br>

                            Display of respectful communication might also be a trigger that earns you up-votes (+10
                            each), I do suspect. In any case it creates a distinctly satisfying experience, IMHO, to
                            treat others as human beings despite technical shortcomings, instead of snapping at them.

                            earns you +2, until you hit the edit reputation cap at 2000. Makes stuff easier to find, to
                            comprehend and nicer to look at.<br><br>

                            Easy wins are code formatting, right now also weeding out non-gender-neutral addressing of
                            the audience ("Hello, guys") instead of staging

                            java.util.Scanner") or setting stuff straight ("I'm using an array" -> its often an
                            ArrayList actually), adding missing tags or re-tagging the post (e.g. `java` gets time and
                            again confused with `javascript`). Tag edits will yield +2 also above 2K, the barrier is at

                            Strangely laziness is the main driver for this, more for bums than evil geniuses. A quote

                            <i> One consulting company listed all their employees' Stack Overflow profiles on their
                                front page, and became quite upset with us when they all were suspended at the same
                                time. I imagine that didn't help them get clients.</i>
